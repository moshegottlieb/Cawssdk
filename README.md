# Cawssdk

AWS SDK module for Swift  

Intended for use by a swift wrapper.
To install, run the "build.sh" script (needs `sudo` with linux), this will install Amazon's SDK for C++ under /usr/local.  
An additional library will be then compiled and installed to /usr/local using the local makefile.  
This library has a pure C interface and as such, can be imported by swift.

```diff
- THIS LIBRARY IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED
```
It is still available as it is needed by an old project of mine, but it is not going to be updated.
